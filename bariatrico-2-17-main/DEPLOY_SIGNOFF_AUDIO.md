- [ ] `NODE_ENV: 'production'` set correctly
- [ ] Debug panels excluded from production bundle
- [ ] Console logging filtered through `productionLogger`
- [ ] Telemetry sampling configured (‚â§1% default OFF)

### ‚úÖ Build Verification
- [ ] No debug imports in production bundle
- [ ] Tree-shaking removed development components
- [ ] Audio files accessible at `/sounds/` path
- [ ] CDN fallback URLs responding (pixabay.com)
- [ ] Baked audio generation working offline

### ‚úÖ Performance Validation

## üîß Technical Smoke Tests

### iOS Audio Unlock Test
```bash
# Test steps on iOS device:
1. Open app in Safari
2. Look for "üîì Ativar √Åudio iOS" prompt
3. Tap to activate
4. Verify first sound plays within 180ms
5. Check status shows "üîì Desbloqueado"

Status: [ ] PASS [ ] FAIL
Notes: ________________________________
```

### Triple Fallback Test
```bash
# Simulate network conditions:
1. Block local /sounds/ files ‚Üí should fallback to CDN
2. Block CDN access ‚Üí should fallback to baked samples  
3. All sounds still playable with baked audio
4. Console shows "SOUND FALLBACK" messages

Status: [ ] PASS [ ] FAIL
Notes: ________________________________
```

### Anti-Spam Protection Test
```bash
# Rapid click test:
1. Click UI element rapidly (>10 times/second)
2. Audio should throttle to max 1 play per 80ms
3. No audio clipping or overlap
4. System remains responsive

Status: [ ] PASS [ ] FAIL
Notes: ________________________________
```

### Volume & Category Test
```bash
# Volume level verification:
1. UI sounds play at -6dB (subtle)
2. Feedback sounds play at -3dB (clear)
3. Special effects play at 0dB (prominent)
4. No clipping with limiter active

Status: [ ] PASS [ ] FAIL
Notes: ________________________________
```

## üìà Telemetry Configuration

### Production Settings
```javascript
telemetry: {
  enabled: false,           // Default OFF
  samplingRate: 0.01,      // 1% when enabled
  events: ['audio_source_used'],
  retention: '7 days',
  endpoint: '/api/telemetry' // If available
}
```

### Telemetry Test
